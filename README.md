# Minecraft-Structure-Lists
All the vanilla structure names for reference. Compliments programs such as Nyveon/MCStructureCleaner

# Why this was created
Either my websearch skills suck or it doesn't exist. I needed to find a list of all the vanilla structures to use them as a baseline for https://github.com/Nyveon/MCStructureCleaner . This handy program is used to remove non-vanilla structures from the game. However, it uses a list to differentiate between vanilla and non-vanilla structures. Since MCStructureCleaner was not updated for 1.19 and used the outdated structure naming convention, the list I created can be substituted to allow 1.19 cleaning support.

# Intention
Hopefully this will save someone time :)
